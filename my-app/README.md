# Chat POC

## Getting Started

 1. [Make a stream account and instance](https://getstream.io/blog/stream-getting-started-guide/)
 2. Get your API key (https://dashboard.getstream.io/app/{YOUR_APP}/chat/integration) and paste these into the chatConfig.ts. Do NOT paste the secret as that is only for the server
 3. Run the dotnet backend
 4. npm run android or npm run ios. Web is not supported by stream.
